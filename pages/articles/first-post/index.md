# My first post

Hi there! I’m now heading for new experiences and so I started this blog. I want to protocol here the thing I learned and the things I will learn also I want to share here some thoughts about me about development themes.

## Its a long way to go

I’m pretty new in web-development and my skills are in general pretty basic but I’m heading forward and really like to challenge me so i written this blog from scratch.

## How this blog is written

Yes I've written the whole thing from scratch. This is a static generated blog and it runs on my still pretty basic [static site genertaor](https://github.com/andresattler/my-static-site-generator).

My static generator its building the pages using the React framework so its pretty modular and easy to configure. It converts posts written in markdown and uses front-matter to get additional informations. Stylus is my preferred preprocessor so my static generator converts stylus to beautiful css.

Today when I’m writing this post it has only the basic functionality to set everything up and the codebase isn't optimised but it will improve in the future.

## Why this all?

I really wanted to try something new and work my self on bigger projects. The idea to write a blog was in my head for a log time now and after reading a lot of other web-development blogs I got really inspired form [ponnyfoo](https://ponyfoo.com/) from Nicolás Bevacqua who has written the blog all its self.

Its started small and it had grown pretty good so far and so will this project also. Because I'm more interested in Frontend at the moment im not so likely to start writing an server side app so I played in mind about using a static site generator. So I've found [gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) and I really loved the idea to use react for templating.

So I setted up gatsby on my local machine and i experimented a little bit but with my pretty basic skills then it wasn't so easy to me to configure it to my will. So I studied the codebase over a time but I don't understand enough so my own static site generator gets born. Over a little time of studying I've understand the core basics and with help of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPpM5-rXrZ4) I' had my first working prototype.

So lets see how far I come...
