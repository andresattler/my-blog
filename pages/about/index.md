Hi I am André and I‘m on my way to become an self-thought Front-End Developer. I really like to face new challenges and I learn also the most of them.

I’m a young and curios German who started at beginning of 2016 to learn about web development first on codeacademy and then I’ve started the FreeCodeCamp program and finished the [frontend Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.com/andresattler/front-end-certification) in October 2016.

Now I’m on leaning new thinks like React through various projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/andresattler).
My goal is to work professionally at least at beginning of 2018.

So I have still a lot to do and to learn and maybe you want to join my path on this blog. I’m also open to every advice or critic.

Feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SattlerAndre) or on my <a href="mailto:andresattler.webdev@gmail.com">E-mail</a>.
